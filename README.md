# My favorite movie & manga

## Look Back
Fujimoto, Tatsuki one of my favorite author in the manga industry released a one-shot manga entitled *"Look Back"*, which got many people loving the story and later on be released as a movie in July 19 2021.

The story of Look Back starts off with a fourth grader Ayumu Fujino regularly draws four-panel manga for her school newspaper and is lauded as having the best artwork in her class. One day, she is asked by her teacher to turn over one of her manga slots in the school newspaper to a truant student named Kyomoto. When Kyomoto's manga pops up alongside Fujino's, it receives high praise for its detailed artwork, making Fujino furiously jealous.

Refusing to be beaten by someone who barely attends school, Fujino devotes herself to learning to create manga. As time goes on though, her goal of outshining Kyomoto seems to only get further and further away; and Fujino, now in sixth grade, eventually gives up and quits making manga.

Graduation day arrives, and Fujino is asked to deliver Kyomoto's graduation certificate to her. Through chance, the two end up coming face to face, and their unexpected meeting will end up having consequences far beyond what either of them could ever predict.

With it's well written story and melodramatic scene which captures Ayumu and Kyomoto friendship and love over creating a manga and how they ended up separating won the hearts of many viewers especially me. I love how all the scenes are captured well and you can feel their excitement and how the music go well with each other. I also love the story itself from the beginning till the end as how Ayumu and Kyomoto bonded with each other.
